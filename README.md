### Description:
- A CETSO optimized exponential entropy image segmentation method is proposed
- Three evolutionary strategies comprehensively improve the performance of TSO
- Eleven intelligent optimization algorithms are evaluated
- Comparing the image segmentation effect of five entropies
- Exponential entropy can reasonably segment sand microscopic images
